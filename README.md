## 00 - intro

This is the main code repository for the FTC Robotics team at the International School of Prague, for the competition that will happen on the 5th of February 2016 at ISP. This repo contains the main Android Studio project, as well as other extra files that help with the competition.

The main android studio code can be found under /ftc_app_master/. The main programming will be going on under /opmodes/ in the /src/ folder of the project, while minor changes will be found in the other folders.

## 03 - contribution guidelines and style

Contribution is usually limited to the main robotics programmers (listed above), who are allowed to make any edits within reason. If you wish to make any drastic changes however please do fork it, we'll usually merge however it's better if we can check the code for potential conflicts with existing stuff.

The style of coding will be regular camelCase GNAT style code (aka the way everyone learnt java). Please do comment stuff too!

If you're not from our team, we probably won't let you edit. Go write your own code!
