# robot-core - FTC Robotics Prague
----

## 00 - intro

This is the main code repository for the FTC Robotics team at the International School of Prague, for the competition that will happen on the 5th of February 2016 at ISP. This repo contains the main Android Studio project, as well as other extra files that help with the competition.

The main android studio code can be found under /ftc_app_master/. The main programming will be going on under /opmodes/ in the /src/ folder of the project, while minor changes will be found in the other folders.

## 01 - how to 'download' this repository

The best (and easiest) way to do this is to first install [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) (also available through Homebrew's Caskroom, if you're familiar with that). Then, go to this repository in your browser ([link here](https://github.com/isphsrobotics/robot-core)), and click the 'save in Github Desktop' button on the top right (next to 'Download ZIP'). The Github app should open, asking you to save the repository. You can save it wherever you want, but it's best if you keep the name ('clone as') as it is.

## 03 - where stuff is

###### Guide to Robotics
Alex wrote a guide to how all of this works, you can find it in the root directory of the repo. The file is called robotics-guide.pdf. You can also [follow this link](https://github.com/isphsrobotics/robot-core/blob/master/robotics-guide.pdf).

###### Bugs, issues, and checklists
This will be found under the Issues tab in github (press `g` `i`)

###### Other links

## 04 - contribution guidelines and style

Contribution is usually limited to the main robotics programmers (listed above), who are allowed to make any edits within reason. Programmers, please make any large changes on a new branch, as per the guide to robotics, so that it is easier to check for problems.

The style of coding will be regular camelCase GNAT style code (aka the way everyone learnt java). Please do comment stuff too!

If you're not from our team, we probably won't let you edit. Go write your own code!
